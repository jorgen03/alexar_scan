One positive of working the Axelar was Steven Fluin. Steven was very communicative and responsive when questions arose when working on our project.
He was also friendly enough to meet with us over a videocall, and he had a nice video series on youtube.

Having a lot of examples and documentation through the Axelar github and website was helpful. The example repository had a plethora of helpful examples when we got it to work.
It was also nice having many readmes to follow along to get the example code running. 

One challenge we faced was getting the example Axelar repository to run. We had difficulties installing NPM and spent a lot of valuable time trying to figure out the issue. 
We found that the repository only worked when running on a unix system. 

The largest difficulty we faced was getting our smart contracts we deployed on the Axelar network to interact with our frontend. 
Our goal was to have a front end that would call a message send transaction on our deployed contracts, but we were unsuccessful in getting this to work.
